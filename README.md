# Hidrobot
Hidrobot is a game jam project developed in 72h.
A timelapse of the development can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIDA12wmvxM

Please don't take this as an example of good practices. Due to the limited time, most of this was really rushed.
All the code is in english and the strings are in brazilian portuguese.

The game needs a dual analog gamepad in order to be played.
Enjoy.
